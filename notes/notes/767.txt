If you have a lot of files that you want to make the same,
partial, modification, use this one line script:
----------------------------------------------------------------
for filename in ./*; do mv "./$filename" "./$(echo "$filename" /
| sed -e 's/_trans4//g')";  done
----------------------------------------------------------------
In this instance '_trans4' was the pattern to delete. All the
rest stays the same.
