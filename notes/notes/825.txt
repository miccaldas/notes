I created two commands in ranger that allow you to extract a
compresssed file, through atool, or create a compressed file
in tar format.
In both cases to select the file put the cursor over the file
you want but don't click on it.
For extracting write:
------------------------------------------------------------
:extract
------------------------------------------------------------
For compressing write:
------------------------------------------------------------
:compress
