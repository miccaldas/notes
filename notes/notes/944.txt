I always felt that it was a bit of overkill, to import 'sys', just so I can use sys.exit().
It turns out, you don't have to. Where you would put the sys.exit() statement, write:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
raise SystemExit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and you're done!
