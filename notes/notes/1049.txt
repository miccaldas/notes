You can see a pickle file content with 'less'.
Through the script 'lesspipe' that I installed
and forgot about it, you can just open it and
you'll see the content.
It's important to note that you'll see only
content, not the structure of the file. That
means, you won't know by 'vim/less' if you're
dealing with a list of lists or a list of tuples.
