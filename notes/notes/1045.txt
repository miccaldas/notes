Ifyou have a shell command that you need to have the
stderr output  available,do this:
-----------------------------------------------------
mv [file] [folder] > results.txt 2> errors.txt
-----------------------------------------------------
This is also interesting inPython for os.system() as
subprocess has other ways to get to error messages.
