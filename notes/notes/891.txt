To be honest, this, until now hasn't worked very well.
But is such a great thing, I'm willing to delve deeper
into this. Let's say you have a bash script with the
following content:
------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/env/bin bash

test1 = "hello
------------------------------------------------------
Supposedly you would need to just do this to make it 
accessible to os.environ:
------------------------------------------------------
export text1
or maybe,
export = TEXT1='hello'
or place it in 'zshenv', I don't know. But I would like
know more.
