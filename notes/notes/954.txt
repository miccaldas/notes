To use 'pynput' or other libraries that need to identify keyboard keys, it's
needed to know the codes by which they are known. As we're using a Xorg system,
it's the Xorg's keycodes that we need. To get them use this command:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xev | awk -F'[ )]+' '/^KeyPress/ { a[NR+2] } NR in a { printf "%-3s %s\n", $5, $8 }'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will, unfortunately, open a gui window, but all the interaction will be in the
terminal. Just press the key that you need to know the code, and Xev will output it's
name and numerical code.
