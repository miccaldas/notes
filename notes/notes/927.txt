If everytime that you save a python file, appears a black error message complaining
about 'unexpected keyword argument preview...', this is most likely result of a old
version of Pip in use in the Black Vim plugin. The plugin doesn't use the system's Pip,
it has its own installation. Because of that, you need to update it thusly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~/.vim/black/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Off course It doesn't hurt to update Black and system Pip also, but this, for me, did
the trick.
