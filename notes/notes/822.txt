 I've created this note so as to have all the information about
 Ripgrep in the same place. There are some moving parts and the
 app is deep when it comes to functionality.
 My first link is to Ripgrep's Github page, that gives a good
 presentation on how to work with the app...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#ripgrep-rg
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 but lacks some information on all the functionalities it offers.
 For that we have this good man page:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 https://www.mankier.com/1/rg
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 As Ripgrep doesn't cover a lot of byte file formats, it was
 needed to get Ripgrep-all, that works as wrapper for the former
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 And, finally, we need to brush up on Rust's version of Regex,
 since that it's what is used to make the queries.
