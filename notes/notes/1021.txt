To get video, and maybe audio, although I haven't tried it yet,
metadata, use python's 'ffmpeg' package. It has bindings that
among other things, let you retrieve metadata. This example gets
the duration of a video:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
ffmpeg.probe(<filename>)["streams"][0]["duration"]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The metadata is kept, at least for mp4, which is what I have more
of, in list called "streams", which houses one dictionary. So if
you want to see all metadata write:
------------------------------------------------------------------
ffmpeg.probe(<filename>)["streams"]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
