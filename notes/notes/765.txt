To delete all empty files in a folder, do:
------------------------------------------
fd -tf -S 0b -x rm
------------------------------------------
'-t' means file type, the 'f' that follows
signifies 'file', '-S' is for 'file size',
'0b' means '0 bytes', '-x' means that what
comes after is a command. In this case
it's the 'rm' command, to delete the files.
