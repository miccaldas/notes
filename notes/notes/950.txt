Stopping the creation of '__pycache__' folders should be something that was
solved with adding this envirnmental variable to '~/.zshenv':
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE = 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But it doesn't work in all folders. It wasn't working in 'cli_apps', for
example. To solve this on project by project basis, write this before all other
imports, as are the imports that trigger the creation of 'pycache':
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import sys
sys.dont_write_bytecode = True
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ideally you would put it on a 'main' file and that would be that. If the project
doesn't have a 'main' file, it'll have to be written in all the modules.
