Getting to the folders of 'partials' and 'configs' in 'reusables_files'
on vim, requires writing quite lengthy paths. To avoid this, I've
created in '.zshenv', two environment variables:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PARTIALS="/home/mic/python/reusable_files/reusable_files/partials
CONFIGS="/home/mic/python/reusable_files/reusable_files/configs
---------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use them in Vim as you would use them in a shell. For example
to open a 'partials' file in current file:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
:r $PARTIALS/<name_of_file.txt>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To see the content of 'partials' folder:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
:Vexplore $PARTIALS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
At the risk of stating the obvious, remember you can use it on the
shell as any other environment variable. For instance:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
vim $PARTIALS/<name_of_file.txt>
