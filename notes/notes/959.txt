This is as involved as it is useful. I've tried to use this to define 
if some network sockets had content or not, and avoid the stress of
using socket selectors, but the convolutedness of defining backspaces
defeated me. Nevertheless, if you have the values of the IP and the 
port number, and you want to know if this address has info to show, by
seeing ss's Recv-Q value, Here is how it's done:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ss -a | awk '$5 == "127.0.0.1:58910" {print $3}'

Where:
    ss -a -> 'ss' displays all sockets,
    awk $5 -> 'Awk' searches the fifth column of ss' results to find
    127.0.0.1:58910 -> this particular IP and Port web address.
    {print $3} -> If condition is true, print the Recv-Q column value,
                  that is the third one.
