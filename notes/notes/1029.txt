If you try to simply append a 
dictionary into a list, it'll give
weird results because the copy its
still ties to the original, and
when one moves, so doies the other.
To avoid this, use this method, that
only copies valus:
----------------------------------
[list].appen([dictionary.copy()])
---------------------------------
