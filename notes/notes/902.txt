To set an encrypted file with a passphrase in GPG
you first need to encrypt it:
------------------------------------------------
gpg -c <file_name>
------------------------------------------------
It'll open a floating window ad ask for a
passphrase. Input it, and it'll generate a file
with the name of your original file plus a
'.gpg' prefix. To decrypt it, do:
-----------------------------------------------
gpg -d <encrypted_file.gpg> > <output_file>
-----------------------------------------------
It'll ask you for passphrase and decrypt.
