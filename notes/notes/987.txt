To serialize and deserialize python objects,
you can use Pickle. To pickle into a file:
---------------------------------------------
import pickle

with open('<pickle_file.bin>', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(<object_to_pickle>, f)
---------------------------------------------
To unpickle a file:
---------------------------------------------
import pickle

with open('<pickle_file.bin>', 'rb') as f:
    <new_object_name> = pickle.load(f)
---------------------------------------------
