'Itertools' has a function that permits to iterate
through several lists simultaneously:
---------------------------------------------------
import itertools

[list1] = [1, 2, 3]
[list2] = ['red', 'white', 'black']
[ist3] = [255, 256]

for (a, b, c) in zip([list1], [list2], [list3]):
    print(a, b, c)

    Output:
        1 red 255
        2 while 256
----------------------------------------------------
You can also use it with zip_longest().
