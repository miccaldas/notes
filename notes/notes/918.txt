I've created some command-line commands for some of Notes' functionalities. They are:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ntadd  Command to add entries to the database. It has these optional flags:
       -t   Title of entry.
       -k   Keywords. Accepts up to three values.
       -n   Note. Opens Vim so you can write a note.
ntdlt  Deletes one, several or range of entries. Call it in the following forms:
       1. Delete non-sequential entries. Example:
          ndlt '435,600'
       2. Delete sequential entries. Example:
          ndlt '437-439'
       3. Delete one entry. Example:
          ndlt '66'
ntupdt  Updates a column value, given a certain id. Has the following options:
        -n   Id of the entry. An integer.
        -c   Column of the entry.
        -u   Update content.
