When debugging programs like Curses or other programs that take
ownership of the terminal window, when entering pdbr, its
window it's all jumbled up. I found this that may help, although
I haven't tried it yet.
The idea is to send the output to another terminal session, in
our case, in another dwm tag. You'll have to find the where the
tty session is hosted in /dev. To know this, go to the terminal
you want to send the output to, and call this linux command:
----------------------------------------------------------------
tty
----------------------------------------------------------------
Invoke the program in this manner:
----------------------------------------------------------------
python <file_you_want.py> 2><dev_path_you_got_from_tty>
----------------------------------------------------------------
