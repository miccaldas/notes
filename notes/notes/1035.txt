If you want to make changes to elements inside a list of lists,
and you don't want to ruin their structure, like what happens
in flattening solutions, you define the change you want in the
element inside a list:
---------------------------------------------------------------
[new_list] = [[i.strip() for i in sublist] for sublist in list]
---------------------------------------------------------------
This preserves the list of lists structure.
