To represent user input in shell scripts,
use '$' + 'integer', chosen by the
arguments precendence. For example, if you
have a script that's called like this:
-------------------------------------------
script.sh <argument>
-------------------------------------------
the argument, has it's only one, is
represented by:
-------------------------------------------
$1
-------------------------------------------
If there were two arguments, they would be
represented by:
-------------------------------------------
$1, $2
-------------------------------------------
