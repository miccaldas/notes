Snoop has a valence called 'pp', that if you envelop an expression,
variable or whatever, it will open it up and show its steps and
values. It's as simple as this:
------------------------------------------------------------------
import snoop
from snoop import pp

pp('expression_you_want_to_monitor')
------------------------------------------------------------------
