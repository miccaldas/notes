For reasons That I know not, python when importing strings from
a file, converts them to lists, which is very upsetting, since
there were good reasons you were keeping them as strings in the
first place.
This a practical example where I was in the situation just
described, and to undo what python had done.
But I noticed that, although python had introduced the '[]' of
a list, its type was in fact string. And if its string, its
manipulation methods apply. So this is what I did:
--------------------------------------------------------------
flst = original list of tuples, with one element being a list.
fflst = Empty list.

for i in flst:
    fflst.append((i[0], i[1][2:-5]))
--------------------------------------------------------------
Since its a string, I used slice notation to remove the
rectangular parenthesis, line breaks, and the double quotes
that made it look like a list.
