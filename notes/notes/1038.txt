Python's 'os' module has a function that, aparently,
does much of the things that subprocess does. I only
tried it for simple things, and there must be reasons
everybody suggests 'subprocess' and not os.system.
However, it's great with simple stuff and you don't
have to make another import.
------------------------------------------------------
import os

os.system('cp [file] [directory]')
------------------------------------------------------
If you have an executable, like a script, pointing to
its path alone wont work. Use 'xdg-open':
-------------------------------------------------------
import os

os.system('xdg-open [path_to_executable]')
--------------------------------------------------------
