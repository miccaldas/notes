To get the creation date of ext4 files, among others, you can use
the 'stat' command:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
stat [file_path]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To get only the birth date of the file, use:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
stat -c '%w' [file_path]
----------------------------------------------------------------

There was a failed attempt at using these values in 'cli_diary'
instead of MySQL timestamps, but they had less information than
the latter. The file is stored in:
~/python/old_alternative_projects/cli_diary/birth_data_file.py
