   Access database: mysql -u [username] -p [database]
   Create new database: CREATE DATABASE [database];
   Select database: use [database];
   logout: exit;


   # ---- Information ----
   Show all databases: SHOW DATABASES;
   Determine what database is in use: SELECT database();
   Show all tables: SHOW TABLES;
   Show table structure: desc [table];
   See 'Create Table' command used: SHOW CREATE TABLE [table];
   List all indexes on a table: SHOW INDEX FROM [table];
   Explain records: EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM [table];

   # ---- Adding/Inserting ----
   Adding a column: ALTER TABLE [table] ADD COLUMN [column] VARCHAR(120);
   Adding a column with an unique, auto-incrementing id: ALTER TABLE [table] MODIFY COLUMN [column] INT AUTO_INCREMENT, ADD PRIMARY KEY([column]);
   Inserting a record: INSERT INTO [table] ([column], [column]) VALUES ('[value]', '[value]');
   MySQL function for datetime input: NOW()
   Selecting records: SELECT * FROM [table];
   Adding a default value to column: ALTER TABLE [table] ALTER COLUMN [column] SET DEFAULT [something]

   # ---- Selecting ----
   (Selectors: <, >, !=; combine multiple selectors with AND, OR)
   Selecting parts of records: SELECT [column], [another-column] FROM [table];
   Selecting specific records: SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] = [value];
   Selecting records where column is empty: SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] IS NULL;
   Select records containing [value]: SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] LIKE '%value%';
   Select records starting with [value]: SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] LIKE 'value%';
   Select records starting with val and ending with ue: SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] LIKE '[val_ue]';
   Select a range: SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] BETWEEN [value1] and [value2];
   Select records with a list of choices: SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] IN ('value1', 'value2');
   Select with custom order and only limit: SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] ORDER BY [column] DESC/ASC LIMIT [value];
   Select 10 highest repeated values in three different columns. Example:
        SELECT tag, COUNT(*) Total FROM
        (SELECT k1 as tag FROM notes UNION All
         SELECT k2 as tag FROM notes UNION ALL
         SELECT k3 as tag FROM notes) GROUP BY tag ORDER BY TOTAL DESC LIMIT 10;
  Select entries with a multi-column condition ('OR', in this case): SELECT title FROM notes WHERE k1 = 'python' || k2 = 'python' || k3 = 'python'";
  Select entries with various WHERE clauses: SELECT * FROM notes WHERE ntid = 54 OR ntid = 64 OR ntid = 480;


   # ---- Deleting ----
   Deleting records: DELETE FROM [table] WHERE [column] = [value];
   Delete a range of records: DELETE FROM [table] WHERE id BETWEEN ... AND ...
   Delete all records from a table (without dropping the table itself): DELETE FROM [table];
   Delete all records in a table: TRUNCATE TABLE [table];
   Delete a index: DROP INDEX [index] ON [table];
   Removing table columns: ALTER TABLE [table] DROP COLUMN [column];
   Deleting tables: DROP TABLE [table];
   Deleting databases: DROP DATABASE [database];

   # ---- Order ----
   Order output randomly: SELECT * FROM [table] ORDER BY RAND()

   # ---- Updating ----
   Updating records: UPDATE [table] SET [column] = '[updated-value]' WHERE [column] = [value];
   Modifying Column: ALTER TABLE [table] MODIFY [column_name] [column_definitions] optionally: FIRST (on column name needed)/AFTER [column_name]
   Deleting Trailing Whitespace: UPDATE [table] SET [column] = TRIM(TRAILING '\n' FROM [column])

   # ---- Import/Export Databases ----
   Export a database dump: mysqldump -u [username] -p [database] > db_backup.sql
   Import a database dump: mysql -u [username] -
