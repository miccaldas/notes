If you're using the Pandas method of connecting to MySQL, there's the
danger that it might produce an error when doing queries with several
parts. As far as I understood it, they use lazy loading, which means 
that sometimes they misplace information and, generally get very 
confused. To prevent this, write thusly the 'cur' definition:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
cur = conn.cursor(buffered=True)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
