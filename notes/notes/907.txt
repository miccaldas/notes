I installed a new markdown plugin that has
support for github-flavored-markdown that,
I hope, will give more degrees of liberty
than the current version. I have it to
start the html page viewer only when I
give a command. The command are these:
------------------------------------------
:InstantMarkdownPreview
   to start it.
:InstantMarkdownStop
   to stop it.
------------------------------------------
