any() returns True if an element of an iterable is True.
As an example, in the 'notes' app, I had a list of tags
that I wanted to know if they were already in the db.
The keyword list is called 'keywords' and the db tag
list is called 'records'.
---------------------------------------------------------
for k in keywords():
    res = [k in i for i in records]
