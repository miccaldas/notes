I installed an app called Trash that deletes files or
folders but keeps a version in a 'Trash' folder.
These are the commands I aliased:
-------------------------------------------------------
t_put - put file/folder in Trash
tempty - empties trashcans
tlist - list trashed files
trestore - restore chosen trash file
trm - remove specific files from trashcan
